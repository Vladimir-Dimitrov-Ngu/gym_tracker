# 💪 Gym Bro Bot: Your Swole-mate in Telegram Form 🏋️‍♂️

Welcome to the Gym Bro Bot project! This ain't your average Telegram bot - it's your personal hype man, progress tracker, and virtual gym buddy all rolled into one buff package.

## 🚀 What's This Bot's Deal?

Ever wished you had a friend who was as obsessed with your gains as you are? Well, wish no more! Gym Bro Bot is here to:

- Track your workouts (because pics or it didn't happen, right?)
- Analyze your progress (prepare for mind-blowing graphs)
- Send motivational quotes (imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger in your pocket)
- Remind you not to skip leg day (you're welcome)

## 🛠 Tech Stack (AKA The Protein Shake of This Project)

- Python (the whey protein of programming languages)
- Telegram Bot API (for sliding into your DMs)
- SQLAlchemy (because your gains deserve a solid database)
- Matplotlib (for charts that will make your biceps jealous)

## 🏗 Project Structure (The Anatomy of Our Swole Bot)

- `main.py`: The main driver of the bot, handling command-line arguments and starting the bot.
- `config.py`: Where all the magic numbers live (like how many days until your next cheat meal).
- `database.py`: Our trusty gym bag, storing all your workout data like a champ.
- `bot.py`: The heart of the operation, with commands to track your workouts and analyze your progress.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions to keep our code clean and readable (because who wants a messy gym bag?).


## 🏋️‍♀️ Getting Swole (I Mean, Started)

1. Clone this repo (git those gains)
2. Install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. Set up your Telegram Bot token (ask @BotFather nicely)
4. Run main.py and flex on your friends

## 🎖 Contributing (Spot Me, Bro)

3. Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature')
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
